# MobilePhone_Blockchain üì±üîó

Welcome to **MobilePhone_Blockchain**, a decentralized mobile phone tracking and verification system built using **Next.js**, **Solidity**, **Web3.js**, and **Ethereum Smart Contracts**. This project demonstrates the use of blockchain technology for securing mobile phone data, tracking ownership, and verifying the authenticity of mobile phones through smart contracts.

With the power of blockchain, users can store mobile phone details like IMEI, brand, model, and ownership history in a decentralized manner. The mobile phones are registered on the blockchain, allowing secure and transparent ownership records and preventing fraud.

## Features üåü

- **Decentralized Mobile Phone Registration**  
  - Register mobile phones with details like IMEI, brand, model, and owner information.
  - Blockchain-based storage ensures that data is secure and tamper-proof.

- **Ownership Verification**  
  - Verify the current owner of any registered mobile phone by querying the blockchain.
  - Prevents fraud and ensures authenticity of mobile phones.

- **Smart Contracts**  
  - Built with **Solidity** to manage the registration, transfer, and verification of mobile phone ownership.
  - Ethereum-based **smart contracts** to handle transactions and ensure trustless ownership tracking.

- **Web3.js Integration**  
  - Interact with the blockchain through Web3.js to read and write data to the Ethereum network.
  - Web-based interface built with **Next.js** for seamless interaction with the smart contract.

- **Ownership Transfer**  
  - Allows users to transfer mobile phone ownership to another address with secure transactions.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Next.js**: Web framework for building the frontend interface.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language used to write the mobile phone registration and verification contracts.
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
- **Ethereum Network**: Blockchain platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.
- **ABI (Application Binary Interface)**: Interface for interacting with the compiled smart contract from JavaScript.
